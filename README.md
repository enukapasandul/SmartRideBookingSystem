This Project is I'm a software engineer at a company specializing in data management, algorithm optimization and system efficiency. Your team is developing an optimized data management system that requires well-structured data storage, processing and retrieval mechanisms.
You company is launching “SmartRide”, an intelligent public transportation system designed to optimize bus routes, manage ticket bookings and predict arrival times. The system must handle vast amounts of real-time data efficiently. Your task is to design and implement robust data structures an algorithm to
• Store and retrieve bus schedules and passenger bookings efficiently.
• Optimize shortest path calculations to determine the most efficient bus routes,
• Manage passenger ticket queues using FIFO data structures to ensure proper service order.
• Implement stack-based processing for handling transaction rollbacks in ticket booking failures.
• Assess algorithm performance through asymptotic analysis to ensure system scalability.
Your role is to design. Specify, implement and assess different ADTs and evaluate their real-world efficiency using appropriate performance metrics and algorithm analysis techniques.
